		<h1>Correlation is not causation</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			For a long time, statisticians have become frustrated when someone claims that a correlation (an observed relationship between two variables) <span>necessarily</span>
			implies that one of those variables <span>causes</span> the other one.
			<!-- <br> tags used to create space between text. -->
			<br><br>
			Some people have used humour to illustrate this point. For example, see this graph, showing the divorce rate in one state of the USA, and the consumption
			of margarine over the same time period. Clearly, margarine has a negative effect on marriages!
